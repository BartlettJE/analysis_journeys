# Overview {.unnumbered}

This book contains data analysis journeys to practice your wrangling, visualisation, and analysis skills in a less structured format than the main PsyTeachR books. We will tell you the end product you are aiming for from a new raw data set we provide, and your job is to break that end product down and identify a list of tasks to get there. Completing an independent data analysis task is the skill set you will need once it comes to assessments and your dissertation, as this is the point where you are the one making decisions.
